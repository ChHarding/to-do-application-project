Project Overview

The Prioritized To-Do List App is an application meant to make life easier when managing tasks from
different responsibilities, both personal and professional. This dynamic, user-friendly tool has been
planned with great organization in mind by letting users create tasks, assign them to a specific priority
level like high, medium, or low, and label them under categories like "Work", "Personal", or "School."
Tasks can also include due dates that will notify you of their soon-to-expire dates so important
responsibilities will not be forgotten.

The users will be able to filter tasks by priority, due date, or category in order to focus on the most
important ones included in their to-do list. Moreover, the history feature in the application is available for
users to review the tasks completed over time and develop a feeling of being productive and
accomplished.
